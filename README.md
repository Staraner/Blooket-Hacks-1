- My [BlooketUI](https://github.com/ZasticBradyn/BlooketUI) repository is just these hacks but better and easier to use

## How to use
First, copy the script that you want to use from the dedicated file.
Then, type in `javascript:` into the adress bar. 
Afterwards, paste in the script that you have copied.
Once you have finished that, just press enter to activate the hack.
The Blooket hack should work immediately after.
